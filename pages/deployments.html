    <h1>Cloud deployment</h1>
    <h2>What is cloud deployment?</h2>
    <p>Cloud deployment is the process of deploying an application through one or more hosting models—software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and/or infrastructure as a service (IaaS)—that leverage the cloud. This includes architecting, planning, implementing and operating workloads on cloud.</p>
    <h2>What are the business benefits of cloud deployment?</h2>
    <p>With an effective cloud deployment model, an organization achieves numerous benefits, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster and simplified deployments. Automate builds that deploy code, databases and application releases, including resource provisioning.</li>
        <li>Cost savings. Control costs using consumption-based pricing and eliminate capex-heavy on-premises environments.</li>
        <li>Platform for growth. Leverage the global infrastructure provided by cloud service providers (CSPs) to seamlessly expand the business into other geographies.</li>
        <li>New digital business models. Exploit the continuous release of features and services by CSPs, incubate new technologies and innovate digital business models.</li>
        <li>Business resiliency. Architect for the availability and fault-tolerance CSPs offer and ensure disaster recovery and business continuity of applications to make the business resilient.</li>
        <li>Agility and scalability. Use autoscaling and scalability to meet peak demands of the business without provisioning for excess capacity.</li>
        <li>Geographic reach. Access applications from any location, on any device, leveraging the connectivity backbone of CSPs.</li>
        <li>Operational efficiency. Use the inherent automation enabled by cloud to increase operational efficiency and reduce human effort.</li>
        <li>A competitive edge. Leverage infrastructure as code and development, security and operations (DevSecOps) to reduce the time to market for new features and stay ahead of the competition.</li>
        <li>Empowered users. Increase productivity by empowering users with self-service options on cloud, such as portals, DevOps pipelines and executive and operational dashboards.</li>
    </ul>
